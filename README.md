## 💡 Usage

- To run the script, execute the following command in an Admin PowerShell:

`irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KimDog-Studios/2025Utility/main/functions/Utility/WPFStarter.ps1 | iex`

Once the shortcuts are made it'll use Powershell 5 or 7(if you have it installed). To launch inside Windows Terminal use the same command above!
